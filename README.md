# RomanNumbers
Roman to Decimal numbers Converter to showcase some javascript.

Following an idea from florinpop17 app ideas, the Roman to Decimal number Converter, [more details here](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Roman-to-Decimal-Converter.md). Added fancy SVGs and background for fun.

I will be uploading it on codepen as well.

Enjoy!
