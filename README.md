# RomanNumbers
Roman to Decimal numbers Converter to showcase some javascript.

Following an idea from [florinpop17 app ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas), the Roman to Decimal number Converter, [more details here](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Roman-to-Decimal-Converter.md). Added fancy SVGs and background for fun.

I uploaded it on [codepen](https://codepen.io/heidimichel_/pen/BarVXKL) as well.

Enjoy!
